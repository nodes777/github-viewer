## Start

Production (minified)
If you haven't run a create-react-app server on your machine before:
`npm install -g serve`
then
`serve -s build`

Development
`npm start`

## Deviations

I included some error handling that wasn't explicitly defined in the design. I also included some accessibility features not defined in the spec. Responsive design was included, but not tested.

NPM Packages:

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
-   [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
-   [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
-   [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)
